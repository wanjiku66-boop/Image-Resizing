How to Resize an Image Using ILoveIMG Free Online Tool
Problem: “File too Large” 
We’ve all run into it before: you’re trying to upload a photo, only to be stopped by an error message: “File too large” or “Image dimensions not supported.” Maybe the site requires a specific size, or your image is just too big to pass through.
So, what do you do? The easiest fix is to quickly resize the image to the required dimensions using a free online tool. In this guide, I’ll walk you through how to do exactly that with ILoveIMG, a free, easy-to-use website that works on both computers and smartphones.
What You’ll Need
Before starting, you’ll need the following:
* A computer, tablet, or smartphone with internet access

* The image you want to resize

* A web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge will all work)
Step 1: Open ILoveIMG
   1. Open your web browser.

   2. Go to https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image. 

   3. You’ll see a large button that says “Select images.”

  

Step 2: Upload Your Image
      1. Click “Select images.”

      2. Browse your device and choose the image you want to resize.

      3. Once uploaded, it will appear as a preview on the page.

  

Step 3: Choose Your Resize Method
ILoveIMG gives you two ways to resize:
         * By pixels: Enter a specific width and height (e.g., 800x600). Use pixels when you know the exact size a site or platform requires.

         * By percentage: Scale the image down (e.g., 50% smaller). Use percentage when you just want to make the image smaller or larger without worrying about specific dimensions.
For most uploads, resizing by pixels works best.
Tip: Check the “Maintain aspect ratio” box so your image doesn’t get stretched.
  

Step 4: Apply the Resize[a]
            1. Enter your desired width (the height will adjust automatically if the aspect ratio is locked).

            2. Click the “Resize Images” button.

            3. The site will process your image instantly.
Warning: You can make an image smaller without losing much quality, but enlarging an image beyond its original size can make it blurry.[b][c]
Step 5: Download Your Resized Image
               1. After processing, click “Download resized images”.

               2. The file will save to your Downloads folder (or Photos app on mobile).

               3. You can now upload it wherever you need.
Bonus: When to Use JPEG vs PNG
                  * JPEG: Best for regular photos. Smaller file size, faster loading.

                  * PNG: Best for images with text, logos, or transparency.
If you’re not sure which to choose, JPEG is usually the safe bet.
